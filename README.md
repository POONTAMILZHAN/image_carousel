# image_carousel

The Frontend Image Carousel project is a web-based application that allows users to view a collection of images in a visually appealing and interactive manner. The images are displayed in a slideshow format, with users able to navigate between images using arrow buttons or by clicking on thumbnail previews of the images.
The project is built using modern frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML and CSS will be used to create the layout and design of the carousel, while the JavaScript will be used to implement the interactive functionality.
